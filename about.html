    <p class = "left-aligned">Hi, I’m Brooke Rotondo, the founder of WeirdSnow, a platform created with one goal in mind: to empower women in the snow sports community. As a passionate rider and an advocate for inclusivity, I believe that snow sports should be for everyone—and that includes creating a space where women feel heard, supported, and celebrated.

    <p>In a sport where women have often been underrepresented, it’s more important than ever that we have a place to connect, share knowledge, and help each other grow. That’s why I created this company—an online resource offering lessons, tips, and a supportive community tailored specifically to the needs and interests of female riders. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced shredder, you’ll find a space here to learn, grow, and exchange insights with like-minded women.</p>
    <p>Snowboarding and skiing are so much more than just sports—they are about freedom, self-expression, and finding your confidence on the mountain. I’m committed to helping women at every stage of their snow sports journey, from learning the basics to mastering tricks and pushing limits. But beyond that, I want to create a supportive, empowering community where women can come together, share their experiences, and lift each other up.</p>    
    <p>At WeirdSnow, we offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Online Lessons: So you can progress at your own pace and build your confidence on the snow.</li>
      <li>Resource Sharing: Tips, tricks, and advice from other females around the world.</li>
      <li>A Supportive Community: A space for women to connect, share stories, and motivate one another in a sport where women are finally claiming their space and making their mark.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My goal is to break down barriers and show women that snow sports are for them, too. You deserve a space where your voice matters, where you can ask questions without hesitation, and where you can take your skills to the next level in a community of supportive riders.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being here and joining the movement. Whether you’re here for lessons or just to be a part of something bigger, I’m so excited to have you as part of the WeirdSnow family.</p>
    <p>Let’s hit the slopes together!</p>
    <p>With love,<br>Brooke Rotondo<br>Founder of WeirdSnow</p>
